Tmp3D is a 3-D software rasterizer written from scratch in nothing but plain-old
JavaScript, just for kicks. It makes use of the `2d` graphics context of the
HTML5 `<canvas>` to draw some graphics primitives and is heavily inspired by
OpenGL sub-routines.

The project is still heavily a work-in-progress and in its very early stages, so
you may take it as it is and expect many more features to follow very soon.

It currently supports

  - a first-person camera with 2 degrees-of-freedom: _yaw_ and _pitch_
  - perspective transformations
  - near & far clipping planes
  - back-face culling
  - flat-shading

and plans to support

  - frustum culling, i.e., triangle clipping
  - depth-sorting
  - affine & perspective-correct texture-mapping
  - occlusion culling (üò©)

### Why?

My main motive for undertaking this project was that it'd be educational,
recreational, and entertaining. I may or may not try and make a game with it at
some point if I'm satisfied with its progress. So, the fact of the matter is,
[have some fun while re-inventing the wheel](https://youtu.be/WniZwxGA_-s).

### Setting up

#### Requirements

- Node.js
- `ejs`
- `express`

After cloning the repository, navigate to the root folder and install the
dependencies using `npm`.

```bash
$ npm install
```

Once all the dependencies are installed, you can start up an Express development
server with:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

To enable the debugging features, run:

```bash
$ npm run start:debug
```

### Controls

  *<sup>__\*__</sup> You should first click <kbd>![LMB]</kbd> on the `canvas` to
  activate mouse controls.*

### Trivia

The project is named after the fact that I'm too lazy to come up with an
original name, so I make up a placeholder name to keep me going until the
first-ever public release of the project, by which time I had already grown
accustomed to the placeholder name and it's too late to come up with a new name,
so I decide to go with it thinking I can pretend it is a deliberate choice of a
name so I can make some silly _backronyms_ with it.
