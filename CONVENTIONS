Coordinate systems
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tmp3D uses column-vectors conceptually, but they are transposed to row-vectors
before getting written in the memory to leverage CPU cache.

A right-handed coordinate system is used, and the untransformed camera is
situated at the origin <0, 0, 0>, looking towards +z.

        /

  <0, 0, 0> -----> +x
      |
      |
      |
     \|/
      +y

The projection plane has its center at <0, 0, zNear>, where `zNear' is
determined by the vertical FOV (`fovy'), where:

           screenHeight
zNear = -------------------
         2 * tan(fovy / 2)

           +z

      +y

The camera has two degrees of freedom and its rotations use Rodrigues'
Axis-angle representation. The yaw is always followed by the pitch. The positive
rotations follow the right-hand rule as well: they are clockwise when looking
towards the positive direction of that particular axis.

The screen-space origin is at <0, 0> and the +y points downwards.

The triangles facing the camera have counter-clockwise winding.

Renderer

The renderer has no sub-pixel accuracy, the screen coordinates are strictly
integers.
